# XV6 Operating System.

XV6 is a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a practical tool for learning about operating systems in the context of a functioning system. It's a re-implementation of Sixth Edition Unix (V6) using ANSI C for modern x86 processors.

# Key Features
Simplistic design for teaching purposes.
Implements basic Unix utilities such as ls, cat, echo, grep, fork, wait, exit, etc.
Supports multiprogramming with a round-robin scheduling algorithm.
Uses protected mode and isolation for process safety.
Includes basic file system, pipes, and I/O system.
Minimalistic kernel providing system call interface.

# Structure
XV6's source code is organized in a way to reflect its functionality:

Kernel: Contains the core of the operating system.
User: Contains the user programs.
Include: Contains the header files.
Makefile: Contains the build instructions for the system.

# Building and Running XV6
To build XV6, you will need a Unix-like operating system and an installation of GCC, along with QEMU for running the system. You can use the provided Makefile to compile and run XV6 with the command make qemu.

# Learning Resources
The source code is extensively commented, and the book "XV6: a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system" can provide further insight into its design and implementation. The book is freely available online and is an excellent resource for understanding the intricacies of XV6.
